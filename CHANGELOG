## v0.4.0

This release updates the hostname to point to the new domain for the Q API, adds additional tests, and is the first release that disassociates itself with the Aplo organization completely.

- Update hostname to point to the new domain name where Q is being hosted.
- The API QClient connects to has no association with the now defunct Aplo LLC
- All tests are run against the live API server (staging has been shut down)
- Client ID and Secret Token are exported as env vars via shell script
- Changelogs are now manually written. It's too easy to pipe the output of `git log` out to a file and call it a day but I'd prefer a `CHANGELOG` that makes as much sense to humans as possible while leaving my Git history as terse as possible

## Pre-release (Versions <= v0.3.1)

The 0.3.x series of releases were all alpha quality. The decision was made to only support the `/plans/` endpoint for the time being.
